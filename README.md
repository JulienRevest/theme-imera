# Iméra WordPress Theme

WordPress theme made during my time at [e-labo](https://e-labo.biz/)

This theme was made using a custom base template, called Dédé, which follows the [WordPress Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)

This is version 1.0.1 of the theme. It uses PHP as its main component, with some JavaScript (mainly for filtering on some pages, infinite loading with AJAX, and some sticky elements), and SCSS for the styling of the theme. For ease of design, this theme also integrate to the Gutenberg's editor, to allow the team at Iméra to add, remove or edit elements of the website.

This theme is one of the first to have been added to e-labo's new updating system, using Easy Digital Download. For security purposes, this functionnality has been removed.
